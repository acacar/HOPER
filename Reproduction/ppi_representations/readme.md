# GEM: Graph Embedding Methods
GEM is a Python package which offers a general framework for graph embedding methods.

Please refer https://palash1992.github.io/GEM/ to access the readme as a webpage.


## Implemented Methods
* node2vec

* Higher-Order Proximity preserved Embedding (HOPE)

## Graph Format
We used undirected graph as protein-protein interaction data.

## Data Format
### Edge List
-Read and write NetworkX graphs as edge lists.

-With the edgelist format simple edge data can be stored

*Example:

Node pairs 

1 2

1 3

2 3
#### How to run HOPER

*Create edgelist (input data)

*Ä°dentify the protein names corresponding to the nodes

*Set parameters

*Determine directed or undirected graph

*Create embeddings
